Compute the posterior pdf, and both prior and posterior predictor pmf for the placenta previa problem, using a conjugate $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ prior, for several values of the parameters, obtaining for each of them a 95% (centered) credible interval and the MAP and posterior expectation estimators of $\\theta$. In particular, reproduce Figure 2.3 and Table 2.1 in BDA3 [1]. Do the same for those $\\alpha_0$ and $\\beta_0$ such that $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha_0,\\beta_0)$ has the same expectation and variance than the piecewise linear nonconjugate prior. Compare the posterior quantities with both priors. \n",
